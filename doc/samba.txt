To install Samba on Raspberry Pi, run

sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin
and add user pi to the local smbpasswd file:

sudo smbpasswd -a pi
Open the smb.conf file for editing in the Nano text editor using

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
and uncomment the security = user line. Scroll down to the end of the file and add a share definition (e.g., for photos; replace </path/to/dir> with the actual path to the directory containing photos):

[Photos]
path = </path/to/dir>
available = yes
valid users = @users
read only = no
browsable = yes
public = yes
writable = yes
Save the changes and restart Samba using

sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
You can now access the defined share from a Windows machine or from an app that supports the SMB protocol.

Shut Down From Linux

Once you’ve set up the computer, you can also shut it down from a Linux system. This requires the samba-common package installed – you can install it on Ubuntu with the following command:

sudo apt-get install samba-common

Once you have, use the following command from a terminal:

net rpc shutdown -I ip.address -U user%password

Replace “ip.address” with the numerical address of the Windows computer, “user” with the username of an account that has administrator privileges on the remote computer, and “password” with the user account’s password. You can add a “-r” option to the command if you want the computer to restart instead of shutting down.
